# Arrays

An array is a type of variable that can be used to group values. Arrays in javascript can include different types of values. Array values can include numbers, letters, words, boolean(true/false) etc.

```

var numbers = [1,2,3];

var letters = ["a","b","c"];

// To access array values you need to use indices start from 0

console.log(letters[0]); // Will print out "a"


```
